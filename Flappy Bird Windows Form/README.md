## How to Play

- Press the **Spacebar** to make the bird jump.
- Release the **Spacebar** to let the bird fall.
- Avoid hitting the pipes or the ground.
- Each time you pass through a set of pipes, your score increases.
- The game ends if the bird touches a pipe, the ground, or flies off the top of the screen.
- As your score increases, the pipes move faster, making the game more challenging.

Try to achieve the highest score possible!
